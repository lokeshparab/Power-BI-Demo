# Power-BI-Demo

The objective of this project is to utilize Power BI to perform comprehensive analysis on the sales data of Kevin Cookie Company. By leveraging the powerful features and capabilities of Power BI, we aim to gain valuable insights into the company's sales performance and identify key trends and patterns.

Using Power BI, we will integrate and visualize the sales data from different sources, including transaction records, customer information, and product data. This will enable us to create interactive and dynamic dashboards and reports that provide a holistic view of the company's sales operations.
